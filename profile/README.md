# Welcome to Jayson Rawlins
This organization is dedicated to building robust, type-safe tools for modern cloud infrastructure and automation. I focus on creating high-quality AWS CDK constructs and GitHub Actions that simplify complex workflows.

## Core Focus Areas:
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Developing constructs for IAM policy building, AMI creation, and RDS management.
* **Developer Experience (DX):** Streamlining CI/CD with tools like cdk-diff-pr-github-action for better visibility into infrastructure changes.
* **Automation Patterns:** Utilizing projen to maintain consistent standards across repositories.
